Overview

This is a Java-based AI recommendation system that suggests items (e.g., movies, products) to users based on their preferences using cosine similarity. The system analyzes user ratings, finds the most similar user, and recommends an item the target user hasn't rated yet.

Features

Uses collaborative filtering for recommendations.

Implements cosine similarity to measure user preference similarity.

Provides personalized suggestions based on past interactions.

Scalable for movies, e-commerce products, books, etc.


Technologies Used

Java (for implementation)

Data Structures (HashMap for user-item ratings)

Mathematical Operations (Cosine similarity for recommendation)


How It Works

1. User Data Storage

Each user has rated a few items (e.g., movies or products).



2. Finding Similarity

The system calculates similarity between users based on ratings.



3. Recommendation Logic

Finds the most similar user and suggests an item the target user hasn't rated.




Setup & Execution

1. Compile the Java Program

javac RecommendationSystem.java

2. Run the Program

java RecommendationSystem

3. Expected Output

If a recommendation is available:

Recommended item for User1: ItemC

If no recommendation is available:

No recommendation available.

Enhancements & Future Scope

Content-based filtering: Recommend similar items, not just based on user similarity.

Hybrid approach: Combine collaborative filtering with deep learning models.

Database integration: Store and retrieve real-world user data dynamically.

Real-time updates: Update recommendations as users rate more items.
